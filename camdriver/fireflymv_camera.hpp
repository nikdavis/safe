/* FireflyMVCamera Class
 *
 * This driver wraps the Point Grey C driver for
 * our camera.
 *
 * version 1.1
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT POINT GREY REGISTERS:
 * Point Grey's registers read out of our device very funky. What we receive
 * is exacly reversed bit-for-bit. It's not just a big vs little endian problem,
 * it's bit-for-bit swapped. E.g. our bit 31, 0 are their 0, 31. This is using
 * their Intel / little-endian (64-bit?) driver. It only gets more confusing though,
 * because multiple-bit values you would set have the bit orientation you would expect:
 * i.e. they are read left to right, even though this is backwards in their scheme.
 * E.g: value spanning 30:31 in their scheme (1:0 in ours) would be read using 30 or 1
 * as the MSB, kind of the opposite of their scheme.
